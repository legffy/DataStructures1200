## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

One complication I faced during development was the tedious task of writing the variables for each class. 
Another issue was a termination error caused by forgetting to initialize default string variables. 
This is relatively easy to avoid by ensuring that all strings are properly initialized. 
Thinking through the programâ€™s flow in detail on paper beforehand saved me a lot of effort during implementation. 
Additionally, cppreference.com and my lecture notes proved to be invaluable resources for debugging and review.

The main takeaway from this assignment was gaining confidence in designing basic class structures in C++. 
While it was somewhat challenging to grasp at first, the logic began to fall into place with each step. 
Planning ahead and referring to appropriate resources played a crucial role in overcoming obstacles, 
ultimately making the overall development and testing process much smoother.
